My solutions for [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021) :)

## Running the tests

Some days will be in [Rust](https://rust-lang.org), some in [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org), and some in both.

To run everything:
```sh
sh ./test.sh
```

To run the Rust solutions, make sure you have Rust and Cargo installed and run:

```sh
cargo test -- --nocapture
```

To run the TypeScript solutions, make sure you have [Deno](https://deno.land) installed and run:

```sh
deno test --allow-read
```
